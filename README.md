# Gloss Corpus
http://www.glossing.org/glosscorpus/

Gloss Corpus is a fully open Access, open-standards resource for the collaborative publication and study of glosses on medieval manuscripts. It aims to support the glossing research community by sharing resources and tools, including tools for data analytics and visualisation (currently still in development).

This resource was developed by Pádraic Moran (University of Galway). It builds on his earlier work on the digital edition of the St Gall Priscian Glosses. It now forms part of a broader research project, Global and Local Scholarship on Annotated Manuscripts (GLOSSAM), funded by Research Ireland, 2022–2026.

Editorial principles:
- Contributors receive full credit for their own content.
- Each collection is citable with its own DOI and persistent URL.
- Collections may be optionally peer-reviewed by an editorial committee.
